# Destiny 2 Geoguessr

## Overview
Destiny 2 Geoguessr is a fan-made web-based game inspired by GeoGuessr, where you must identify in-game locations from Destiny 2. You are shown an image of a random location from the game and must pinpoint its coordinates on one of the different maps.

## Features
- **Randomized Locations:** Over 100 unique in-game locations with corresponding images and coordinates!
- **Interactive Map Selection:** Choose a specific map from various Destiny 2 destinations (e.g., Cosmodrome, Dreaming City, Europa, etc.).
- **Image-Based Guessing:** Players must match an image to a location and submit their best guess.
- **Score System:** Track accuracy and "award points" based on proximity.

## How to play New Version
There are currently two version. **The "NEW VERSION" is work in progress, and is not polished at all.**
1. Go to the NEW VERSION folder
2. Double click the **index.html** file to open the file in your browser.
3. Press "Play" to start the game. A location should be located on your screen, and if you scroll down there will be a bunch of buttons, each of which will open up their respective map.
4. Mark your guess on which map and where on the map you think the picture is taken from, by clicking on the map with your mouse.
5. Press "submit" to submit your guess.
6. Press next to go to the next round, where you will be presented with a new location.
7. View your total score and results for each round after all 5 rounds have concluded. Press "play again" to start over, and improve your accuracy! 

## How to play Old Version
There are currently two version. **The "OLD VERSION" is no longer supported, and will not receive any more updates.
1. Go to the NEW VERSION folder
2. Double click the **main.html** file to open the file in your browser.
3. Click the Play button on the main screen.
4. A random in-game location will be selected. It can be viewed from the grey "Show Location" button which you should be able to see at the bottom of the screen.

## Installation & Setup

   git clone https://github.com/NiklasBH/Destiny-2-Geoguessr.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

## Future Enhancements (NEW VERSION Only)
- **Scoring system**: Developing an algorithm that better rewards points based on distance. For example, I do not the only way of achieving a perfect score to be if the player marks the coordinates to the dot. There should be some lee-way
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Setting the code up so it runs on a server, allowing you to compete with friends (and just playing online).
- **More Locations**: Expand the database with additional in-game places.
- **Improving UI**: The program looks very basic and unpolished... Because it is very basic and unpolished.
- **Better maps**: I've received some maps from others that I could update the code with, so the maps are less patched-together. I expect this feature to be coming soon!
